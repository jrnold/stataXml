* TODO man pages
* TODO fix empty xml tree warning.
* DONE handle writing numeric missing values ("." instead of "NA")
* DONE unit tests / tests for reading and writing. 
** DONE date/times for write.stataXml
** DONE missing values for write.stataXml
* TODO add ability to read from URLs like read.dta does.
* TODO only write factors for variables with value labels if all values have labels. 

This is how read.dta handles it.
* TODO handling very large floats and double values that may be mistaken for missings.

See note in write.dta

* TODO check that time-zones are handled consistenly in (from|as)StataTime.
* TODO Support tis, ts, and timeDate in asStataTime()
* TODO abstract xml writing to a write Stata data frunction.
* TODO write a function equivalent to write.foreign()
* TODO Incorporate binary read write into this package

This will create an equivalent to (read|write).dta with improved handling of dates, formats,
labels, characteristics, etc. It will also be nice because it will separate the data conversion
from the writing to a specific Stata format.
